<h3>Result Formats</h3>



Normally when you query a GSAC repository the results are returned as HTML. However, there are a number of output 
formats available listed under the &quot;Results&quot; section of the search form. For example, there are CSV and JSON 
formats for site search results. For data files there is a file downloader available (requires Java Webstart)
as well as output formats listing the URLs, zipping the data files, etc.
