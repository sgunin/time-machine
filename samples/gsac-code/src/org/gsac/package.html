<h2>What's here?</h2>


gsl: This is the core GSAC Service Layer implementation
<p>

client: Java based client for accessing a GSAC repository
<p>

ramadda: The RAMADDA GSAC plugin
<p>

federated: This is the implemention of the federated repository
<p>


<h2>Generating your initial repository package</h2>

The template directory holds a template of an initial GSAC repository package 
implementation. What you need to do is define a set of macro values
that are used to take the code in the template package and make an initial
Java package 
<p>
Copy the example template/macros.properties file to your own file, e.g.:
<pre>
   cp template/macros.properties    yourmacros.properties
</pre>

Edit the yourmacros.properties and define the target package name, directory, etc.
<p>
Then run (from this directory, i.e., /src/org/gsac):
<pre>
ant -propertyfile yourmacros.properties makerepository
</pre>

This will copy all of the source and resource files templates, replacing the macros with
the values you defined in yourmacros.properties and place them in the specified target directory. 
<p>
Now, the hard part... 
You need to actually implement your repository. See the README and the package.html file in the generated package.
