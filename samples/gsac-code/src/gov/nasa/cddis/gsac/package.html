<title>GSAC Example Implementation</title>


<body>

This package contains an example implementation that can be used as a starting point
when developing a GSAC Repository. 

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

You will need to:
<ul>
<li> Copy this directory to somewhere under your source tree.
<li> Change the package names.
<li> Optionally change the class names (e.g., from StationManagerImpl to "Your Repository"StationManager
<li> Implement the actual queries and other methods - look for the CHANGEME comments
</ul>

<h2>Database Tables</h2>
A useful facility is the generation of a Tables.java class from your database schema. 
This class contains static inner classes for each of your tables that hold the table name 
and the fully qualified names of the columns.
